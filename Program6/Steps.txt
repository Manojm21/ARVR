For converting to android apk:

✅ Step 1: Switch Platform to Android
Go to File > Build Settings.
In the Platform list, select Android.
Click “Switch Platform”.
Unity will recompile your project for Android (This may take a while).

✅ Step 2: Install Android Build Support (If Not Installed)
Open Unity Hub.

Click on the Installs tab.
Click the three dots (...) next to your Unity version and select “Add Modules”.
Check the boxes for:
Android Build Support
OpenJDK
Android SDK & NDK Tools
Click Install.

✅ Step 3: Configure Player Settings

Go to File > Build Settings > Player Settings.
In the Inspector Window, under Other Settings:
Identification:
Set Package Name (e.g., com.yourcompany.yourapp).
Minimum API Level: Set it to at least Android 7.0 (API Level 24) or higher (depending on your needs).
Target API Level: Set it to Highest Installed.
Scripting Backend: Use IL2CPP (for better performance) or Mono (for smaller APK size, but not recommended for production).
ARM64 Architecture: Enable this if you want compatibility with modern Android devices.
Graphics APIs: Make sure OpenGLES3 or Vulkan is selected.
In the Publishing Settings:
Set up your Keystore if you want to upload to the Google Play Store.


✅ Step 4: Vuforia Configuration (Important)

In the Project Window, go to Assets > Vuforia > Configuration.
Enter your Vuforia License Key.
Set your desired Max Simultaneous Tracked Images, etc.
Save Settings.

✅ Step 5: Build the APK
Go to File > Build Settings.
Click “Build” (or “Build and Run” if your Android device is connected via USB with Developer Mode enabled).
Choose a location to save the APK.
Wait for Unity to build the APK file.

✅ Step 6: Test Your APK
Copy the APK to your Android device (or deploy directly if using Build and Run).
Install the APK on your device and open it.
Test your Vuforia AR app.
