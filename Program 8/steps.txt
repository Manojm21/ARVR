Sure! Here’s a *detailed and simple step-by-step guide* for adding a custom animation to *UnityChan, playing an **MP4 video, and adding an **MP3 sound with a button press* in Unity.

---

## *Step 1: Add UnityChan to Your Scene*
1. Open Unity.
2. *Import the UnityChan asset* (if not already imported).
3. In the *Project window*, go to Assets > UnityChan > Prefabs.
4. *Drag "UnityChan" into the Hierarchy* (this places her in the scene).
5. *Click on UnityChan* in the Hierarchy to select her.

---

## *Step 2: Remove Built-in Animation*
1. *In the Inspector, find the **Animator Component*.
2. Click the *three dots* (top-right corner of the Animator component).
3. Click *Remove Component* to delete UnityChan's built-in animations.
4. If there are *any other scripts or components related to animations*, remove them.

---

## *Step 3: Add a Button to the UI*
1. In the *Hierarchy*, right-click and select:
   - UI > Button (this adds a button to the scene).
2. Select the new button in the *Hierarchy*.
3. In the *Inspector*, find the Text component and rename it (e.g., *Jump*).
4. Rename the button itself to *JumpButton* for easy identification.

---

## *Step 4: Open the Animation Window*
1. *Select UnityChan* in the *Hierarchy*.
2. At the top of Unity, go to *Window > Animation > Animation*.
3. The *Animation window* will appear.
4. Click *Create* to make a new animation.
5. Name it *JumpAnimation* and click *Save*.

---

## *Step 5: Create the Jump Animation*
1. In the *Animation window, click the **Red Record button*.
2. Move the *timeline cursor* to 0:00 (start).
3. Change UnityChan’s *position* slightly upwards (Y-axis).
4. Move the *timeline cursor* to 0:50 (half a second).
5. Move UnityChan back down to the original position.
6. Click *Stop Recording*.

---

## *Step 6: Set Up the Animator*
1. At the top of Unity, go to *Window > Animation > Animator*.
2. In the Animator window:
   - *Right-click in the empty space* > Select *Create State > Empty*.
   - Rename it to *JumpState*.
   - *Right-click JumpState* > Select *Set as Default State*.
   - *Right-click "Any State"* > Select *Make Transition* > Click JumpState.

---

## *Step 7: Add an Animation Trigger*
1. In the *Animator window, look for the **Parameters* section.
2. Click *"+"* and select *Trigger*.
3. Name it *JumpTrigger*.
4. Click the *Transition Arrow* between Any State and JumpState.
5. In the *Inspector, under "Conditions," select **JumpTrigger*.

---

## *Step 8: Assign the Animator Controller*
1. In the *Assets folder, right-click **Create > Animator Controller*.
2. Name it *CustomUnityChanController*.
3. Go to *UnityChan* in the *Hierarchy*.
4. Drag *CustomUnityChanController* into the *Animator Component* in the Inspector.

---

## *Step 9: Add a Script to Play the Animation*
1. In the *Assets folder, right-click **Create > C# Script*.
2. Name it *JumpButtonScript*.
3. *Double-click the script* to open it in Visual Studio or any code editor.
4. Replace the code with the following:

   csharp
   using UnityEngine;
   using UnityEngine.UI;

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class program8 : MonoBehaviour

{
    private Animator anim;
    
    public void Start()
    {
        anim = GetComponent<Animator>();
    }

    public void PlayJumpAnimation()
    {
        anim.SetTrigger("Jump"); 
    }
}
   

5. *Save the script* (Ctrl + S or Cmd + S).

---

## *Step 10: Attach the Script to UnityChan*
1. *Select UnityChan* in the *Hierarchy*.
2. In the *Inspector, click **Add Component* and search for *JumpButtonScript*.
3. In the script settings:
   - Drag *UnityChan's Animator* from the Inspector into the unityChanAnimator field.
   - Drag the *JumpButton* from the Hierarchy into the jumpButton field.

---

## *Step 11: Add an MP3 Sound*
1. Drag your *MP3 file* into the *Assets folder*.
2. Select *UnityChan* in the Hierarchy.
3. Click *Add Component > Audio Source*.
4. Drag your *MP3 file* into the Audio Clip field in the *Inspector*.
5. Uncheck *Play on Awake* so it doesn’t start automatically.
6. Open the *JumpButtonScript* and modify it to play sound:

   csharp
   using UnityEngine;
   using UnityEngine.UI;

   public class JumpButtonScript : MonoBehaviour
   {
       public Animator unityChanAnimator;
       public Button jumpButton;
       public AudioSource jumpSound;

       void Start()
       {
           jumpButton.onClick.AddListener(PlayJumpAnimation);
       }

       void PlayJumpAnimation()
       {
           unityChanAnimator.SetTrigger("JumpTrigger");
           jumpSound.Play();
       }
   }
   

7. Save the script.
8. In Unity, select *UnityChan* and drag the *Audio Source* component into the jumpSound field in the script.

---

## *Step 12: Add an MP4 Video*
1. Drag your *MP4 file* into the *Assets folder*.
2. *Right-click the Hierarchy* > UI > Raw Image (this will be the video screen).
3. Rename it *VideoScreen*.
4. *Right-click the Hierarchy* > Create Empty, name it *VideoPlayer*.
5. With *VideoPlayer selected, click **Add Component > Video Player*.
6. In the *Video Player* settings:
   - Drag the *MP4 file* into the Video Clip field.
   - Under Target Texture, click *Create New Render Texture* and name it VideoTexture.
7. Select *VideoScreen* in the Hierarchy.
8. In the *Inspector*, find Raw Image > Texture and assign *VideoTexture*.
9. The video will play when the scene starts. If you want to control it with a button:
   - Modify the *JumpButtonScript*:

   csharp
   using UnityEngine;
   using UnityEngine.UI;
   using UnityEngine.Video;

   public class JumpButtonScript : MonoBehaviour
   {
       public Animator unityChanAnimator;
       public Button jumpButton;
       public AudioSource jumpSound;
       public VideoPlayer videoPlayer;

       void Start()
       {
           jumpButton.onClick.AddListener(PlayJumpAnimation);
       }

       void PlayJumpAnimation()
       {
           unityChanAnimator.SetTrigger("JumpTrigger");
           jumpSound.Play();
           videoPlayer.Play();
       }
   }
   

10. Save the script.
11. In Unity, drag the *VideoPlayer* object into the videoPlayer field.

---

## *Step 13: Test Everything*
1. Click *Play*.
2. Click the *Jump Button*:
   - UnityChan will jump.
   - The MP3 sound will play.
   - The MP4 video will start playing.
