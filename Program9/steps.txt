Adjust size as needed.

Step 3: Creating the Player (Capsule)

Hierarchy > Right-click > 3D Object > Capsule.
Rename to Player.
Position: X = 0, Y = 1, Z = 0 (Above terrain).
Add Rigidbody component:
Inspector > Add Component > Rigidbody.

Step 4: Creating the Coin (Sphere)

Hierarchy > Right-click > 3D Object > Sphere.
Rename to Coin.
Position: X = 0, Y = 0.5, Z = 5 (Above terrain).

Increase Font Size to around 30 for visibility.
Make sure there’s a Canvas object in the Hierarchy.

Step 6: Adding Player Controller Script

Create a script called PlayerController.cs and attach it to the Player.


✅ Part 2: Level Switching (Using Button)
Step 7: Creating Level2 Scene

File > New Scene > Basic (Built-in) or New Scene.
Save as Level2.
Create a Terrain and basic objects to differentiate it from Level1.

Click Build if you want to test outside the Unity Editor.

Step 9: Adding Button to Switch Scene

In Level1, Hierarchy > Right-click > UI > Button.
Rename to NextLevelButton.
Adjust RectTransform position to be visible.
Change button text to Next Level.

Step 10: Adding SceneController.cs Script

Create a script called SceneController.cs and attach it to Main Camera or an empty GameObject.

Step 11: Linking Button to SceneController

Click NextLevelButton in Hierarchy.
In Inspector > Button (Script) > On Click(), click +.
Drag Main Camera (or GameObject with SceneController.cs) to Object field.
Select SceneController > LoadNextScene.
